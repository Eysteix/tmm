# Taste Mummies Made Restaurant (TMM) Project

## Project Overview

**Taste Mummies Made Restaurant (TMM)** is a breakfast delivery service that brings homemade, nutritious meals directly to customers. The brand combines traditional cooking values with modern technology to provide healthy, affordable breakfast options.

## Brand Story

### Founder's Journey
The restaurant was founded by **Mr. Selasi Atakey Y. Christopher**, whose entrepreneurial journey began at age 12 when he helped his mother with her roadside koko (porridge) business in Nyive, a border town. This early experience instilled in him:
- Discipline and work ethics
- Respect for customers
- Understanding of honest business practices

His culinary passion was further developed through formal education in Home Economics during Junior High School, where he gained foundational knowledge in:
- Food preparation
- Hygiene standards  
- Nutrition principles

The official planning for TMM began on **February 25th, 2025** during a lecture session with support from friends, loved ones, and believers in the vision.
